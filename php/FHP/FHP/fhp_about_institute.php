		<p id="section-about">
			The Carolina Institute for Faith and Culture (CIFC) was envisioned in 2017 by Dr. Basil ‘Chad’ Chisholm as a regional institute and information hub to promote both active public engagement and liberal, humanistic learning from a Christian perspective. CIFC is housed within Southern Wesleyan University where it offers students and faculty a venue to exhibit work and influence Christian culture in the Carolina region and world beyond. The creation of CIFC is in keeping with the academic mission of the Division of Humanities and College of Arts and Sciences. CIFC also seeks to extend the core values of Southern Wesleyan University, which are contagious generosity, inventive learning, and fostering a faith-filled community.

		<p id="section-about">
			CIFC exists to promote the active, open exchange of ideas and to support collaborative and creative projects with other institutions and the general public. To this end, the Institute is committed to maintaining a digital publication platform, hosting humanities events, and promoting public literacy. The creation of a digital publishing platform for CIFC is the reason Dr. Chisholm, Dr. Lewis Knight, and Professor David Stubblefield founded the digital publication platform Freedom’s Hill Primer.

		<p id="section-about">
			In addition to providing a service from SWU to the community, CIFC and its various outlets will enable the community to contribute to the learning and academic culture at SWU. Beyond the confines of our digital community and virtual academic forums, CIFC in the future hopes to sponsor conferences and community events on the campus of Southern Wesleyan University, which in turn will further enhance the professional and educational opportunities of our faculty and students.
		</p>
		<p id="section-about">
			CIFC also seeks to provide new and innovative classroom opportunities for our students. CIFC and its outlets enable SWU faculty to have a platform where classes can be ‘flipped’ and students can be engaged in more active learning environments. Furthermore, preparing their documents for digital publication will change how students see their classroom activities and class assignments. Indeed, the benefits for SWU students are numerous, especially when it comes to their career options. For example, having digital publications that they can include on their LinkedIn accounts and/or share with prospective employers will be very beneficial to them.
		</p>
		<p id="section-about">		
			Finally, Southern Wesleyan University will benefit from the increased visibility that CIFC and the website provide for the work of our Division, the College of Arts and Sciences, and our students. What excites us most are not the outcomes we at CIFC can foresee, but the outcomes that we cannot. Thanks to the work of our team, the next few years will be both interesting and productive.
