			Our website journal is maintained by our faculty and students from the 
			Southern Wesleyan University community. However, the purpose for our online 
			publication is to serve the broader community both as a resource and as a space for the exchange of ideas that promote the study of the liberal arts.<br><br>
	 
			While we at Freedom&#8217;s Hill Primer welcome all points of view, our primary purpose is to provide a creative space for scholars and writers to explore and produce ideas that expand our understanding of contemporary literature and film, popular culture, and classical thought that contributes to the Christian experience.
